# U-Net Image Segmentation

This project focuses on image segmentation using a U-Net architecture.
Currently, it includes dataset preparation, splitting, and a modular
project structure for training a segmentation model.

- Model training in progress

# Acknowledgements

This project is implemented as a follow-along learning exercise ispired by Aladdin Persson's U-Net image segmentation tutorials.

While the core model architecture and training approach are based on the tutorial, the dataset preprocessing pipeline, including train-validation splitting and overall project structure, has been independently implemented and customized.
